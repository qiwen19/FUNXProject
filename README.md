# Introduction
"FUNX" is an interactive navigation mobile application. The primary motivation behind the creation of “FUNX” is the resultant of a joint effort between LTA and SIT in trying to provide the general public with a more enjoyable FMLM journey whilst also promoting walking. One key feature behind our mobile application is that it capitalizes on the use of AR to bring fun and enjoyment whilst eliminating monotonicity to commuters as they frequent from one destination to the next. It adopts a point-based system where users can exchange the points earned for rewards as an incentive to walk more. Points are awarded to commuters upon successfully traveling from one location to another. Bonus points will also be awarded when users explore new routes, or successfully completes the challenges proposed to them. These challenges will provide an interesting twist leading to a more interactive and dynamic environment as compared to other navigation systems. The application also allows the community to provide feedback upon completion of their travels to warn or recommend the route to other users.
